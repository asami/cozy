# Logical UI Model Design

Document role: normative design for the Cozy-owned Logical UI authority kernel.
The executable contract is [`docs/spec/logical-ui-model.md`](../spec/logical-ui-model.md).
This design owns `cozy.logical-ui.v1` only; it does not define screen projection,
HTML rendering, target-framework generation, or CML/CNCF source semantics.

## 1. Authority boundary

Logical UI v1 is a consumer of a public Component surface and of three explicit
UseCase identities. It never creates a parallel Entity, Aggregate, Operation,
or UseCase model.

```text
identity-pinned public Component surface + Business/System/UI UseCase references
  -> normalized Logical UI candidate
  -> explicit acceptance decision bound to the exact candidate identity
  -> accepted Logical UI authority

raw prompts / codec bytes / review HTML / route tables / target code / caches
  -> non-authoritative projections or transport only
```

The candidate is reviewable semantic input, not accepted authority. An
`AcceptanceDecision` is the sole feedback-decision form in v1 and must name one
exact candidate identity. The accepted value is constructed only when that
binding validates. A candidate identity, canonical consumed-input identity,
feedback-decision identity, and accepted identity have separate semantic roles.

## 2. Component public-surface binding

Every Component reference is the exact triple `(namespace, id, version)`. Its
canonical qualified name is literally `namespace.id`; version remains part of
the identity-pinned coordinate. The v1 IR never derives a local name, searches
private CML, or resolves a nearest version.

`ComponentSurface` records an exact coordinate and its closed vector of public
opaque export IDs. `ComponentBinding` repeats the exact coordinate and one
export ID. A binding is admitted only when an equal coordinate is declared in
the candidate input and that surface explicitly lists the export ID. Opaque
export IDs are compared exactly and are not parsed into a guessed model path.

## 3. Three-layer UseCase boundary

`Business`, `System`, and `UI` are distinct v1 layers. A candidate contains one
nonempty, pairwise-distinct identity for each layer and exactly these explicit
realization relations:

```text
Business UseCase -> System UseCase -> UI UseCase
```

The relations are values, not inheritance or a name convention. A direct
Business-to-UI link, a reversed relation, a missing layer identity, a duplicate
identity, or any extra v1 relation is rejected. LUI43-02 later owns mappings
from UI UseCase steps to screens; this kernel owns no screen, route, widget,
or target interaction.

## 4. Normalization and identity

Candidate construction first validates the closed public-surface and UseCase
inputs, then sorts Component surfaces by full coordinate, export IDs
lexicographically, bindings by coordinate plus export ID, and realization
relations by source/target layer and identity. The canonical logical content is
UTF-8 JSON in a declared field order. The candidate semantic identity is its
`sha256:<64-lowercase-hex>` digest. Equivalent vector ordering therefore cannot
change the candidate or consumed-input identity.

The candidate document includes an `inputIdentity` derived from the normalized
logical content under the `consumed-input` role. The decision identity derives
from the decision ID and candidate identity under the `acceptance-decision`
role. The accepted identity derives from the candidate, consumed-input, and
decision identities under the `accepted` role. No timestamp, cache, file path,
codec whitespace, HTML, or renderer state participates in any of these hashes.

## 5. Intentional non-goals

The kernel does not expose all Component vocabulary; it merely admits exact
public references for later use. It has no CML grammar, source reader, HTML
renderer, screen composition, projection policy, Widget/Flutter abstraction,
or automatic acceptance. LUI43-02 through LUI43-05 own those later concerns.
