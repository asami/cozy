# Cozy Development Strategy

Date: 2026-05-12

Status: active

## Purpose

This document defines Cozy's standalone development strategy.

Cozy is no longer only a CML-to-Scala generator. Its role is expanding into a
compiler and publication toolchain for engineering knowledge.

The strategic direction is:

```text
source repository
  -> engineering model extraction
  -> generated publication knowledge
  -> SmartDox site BoK source
  -> CAR/SAR/repository artifacts
```

## Strategic Roles

Cozy owns compiler-like responsibilities:

- CML and SmartDox-based model compilation
- sbt project scaffold generation
- CAR/SAR project and archive generation
- engineering metadata extraction from source repositories
- normalized publication source generation
- AI-facing catalog source generation

SmartDox site owns rendering responsibilities:

- HTML/PDF/site projection
- navigation
- multilingual presentation
- site-specific layout

SimpleModeling.org owns the published knowledge platform structure:

- `/ja`
- `/en`
- `/glossary`
- `/ontology`
- `/schema`
- `/smartdox`
- `/textus`
- `/catalog`
- `/samples`
- `/repository`
- `/maven` (legacy compatibility)

Cozy should generate the semantic inputs that allow SmartDox site to build the
BoK and AI-facing engineering knowledge platform.

## Boundary Principles

### Cozy Generates Publication Knowledge

Cozy should produce stable, normalized publication sources such as:

- catalog metadata
- sample metadata
- source tree manifests
- component metadata
- topology metadata
- runtime artifact metadata
- generated SmartDox fragments when needed

These outputs belong in a generated `src/main/publication` workspace.

### SmartDox Site Renders Publication Knowledge

SmartDox site should consume generated publication knowledge and render it into
`website.d`.

It should not become responsible for extracting repository semantics or
packaging release artifacts.

### warehouse Stores Persistent Artifacts

Release artifacts such as CAR, SAR, ZIP packages, checksums, and Maven artifacts
should be treated as persistent and versioned.

They should not be confused with disposable `website.d` output.

## Roadmap

### Phase 4: State Machine Integration Alignment

Status: completed.

Purpose:

- align Cozy state machine generation with CNCF/core execution primitives

### Phase 5: Engineering Publication Compiler

Status: completed.

Purpose:

- create knowledge source from sbt projects
- generate SmartDox site BoK inputs
- align output with the SimpleModeling.org AI-era site structure

Primary reference:

- `docs/journal/2026/05/engineering-publication-compiler.md`
- `/Users/asami/src/dev2025/simplemodeling-org/docs/journal/2026/05/site-structure-expansion-for-ai-era-engineering-knowledge-platform.md`

### Phase 6: Component Repository Publication and Scaffolding

Status: completed.

Purpose:

- make CAR/SAR catalog and publication flow first-class Cozy workflows
- align `cozy`, `sbt-cozy`, and `textus` around component repository metadata
- add Cozy-owned component initialization/scaffolding for projects such as
  `textus-knowledge-editor`

Primary reference:

- `docs/phase/phase-6.md`
- `docs/phase/phase-6-checklist.md`
- `docs/journal/2026/05/car-sar-catalog-publish-plan-2026-05-20.md`

### Phase 7: BoK Source and Site Operations Toolchain

Status: completed.

Purpose:

- make BoK source creation, category management, HTML build, and local preview
  first-class Cozy workflows
- support source-project and published-site project separation by default
- use SmartDox category-driven structure without `site-structure.yaml`
- support Japanese single-locale BoK operation with root `website.d` output
- use the standard Cozy toolchain Docker image for Antora-based HTML generation

Primary reference:

- `docs/phase/phase-7.md`
- `docs/phase/phase-7-checklist.md`

### Future Phase: Model-Driven CAR Project Scaffolding

Purpose:

- make `car-sbt-project` scaffold generation model-driven instead of
  Notice-template-driven
- connect scaffold options to generated CML, factory overrides, and web metadata

## Current Priority

Phase 6 and Phase 7 are closed.

The next development target should be selected as a new phase. Candidate
directions include:

- BoK publication and Component Repository public pages
- Knowledge source compiler expansion
- Model-driven CAR project scaffolding
