# Cozy

Cozy is an open-source **code generation engine** for the  
SimpleModeling ecosystem.  
It transforms models written in **CML (Cozy Modeling Language)** into  
executable, strongly-typed source code — currently focusing on **Scala**.

Cozy is a key component of **Literate Model-Driven Development (LMDD)**,  
integrating documentation, domain models, and code generation into a unified,  
knowledge-centric workflow.

## Key Features

### 🧩 1. Code Generation from CML
Cozy currently focuses on generating high-quality **Scala** source code  
from SimpleModeling’s CML model definitions.

Features include:
- Domain-aware model extraction  
- Data model and type definitions  
- Idiomatic Scala code generation  
- Clear, maintainable code output suitable for real-world projects

---

### 📝 2. Designed for Literate Model-Driven Development (LMDD)
Cozy pairs naturally with **SmartDox**, which extracts structured  
representations (XML / JSON / JSON-LD) from literate documents.

Future versions will allow Cozy to consume these representations directly.

---

## JavaScript / TypeScript Ecosystem Integration (Future Direction)

While Cozy does **not** currently generate TypeScript, the long-term design  
anticipates integration with the JavaScript ecosystem through **Scala.js**.

Planned directions include:

- Generating Scala.js-compatible models  
- Producing JavaScript output via Scala.js  
- Providing optional TypeScript glue declarations  
  (e.g., `.d.ts` files for interoperability)  
- Integration with modern JS/TS build tools  
- Generating API bindings or data-model stubs for TypeScript applications

This approach keeps Scala as the source of truth while enabling seamless  
interaction with JS/TS environments.

---

## Vision

Cozy’s long-term direction goes beyond code generation.

The project aims to evolve into a **Knowledge Worker’s Workbench** for the  
SimpleModeling ecosystem — an environment where:

- documentation  
- domain models  
- semantic knowledge graphs  
- generated code  
- and AI-assisted workflows  

all work together.

Planned areas of exploration:

- Direct consumption of SmartDox XML/JSON/JSON-LD  
- Semantic reasoning via RDF/ontology  
- AI-assisted model refinement  
- Bidirectional editing between documents and code  
- Tooling support for knowledge workers (designers, modelers, developers)

This vision is long-term and exploratory.  
Current releases emphasize **stable Scala code generation from CML**.

## Installation

Add Cozy to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.simplemodeling" %% "cozy" % "<version>"
```

CLI tooling will be provided in future releases.

---

## Example Usage

### Generate Scala code from CML
```bash
cozy generate --input model.cml --out src/generated
```

### Use Cozy programmatically
```scala
import org.simplemodeling.cozy.*

val model = CmlParser.parseFile("model.cml")
val scalaSources = ScalaGenerator.generate(model)
```

## Cozy in the SimpleModeling Workflow

```
SmartDox Document (text)
        │
        ▼
Structured Extraction (XML/JSON/JSON-LD)
        │
        ▼
Cozy (code generator)
        │
        └─ Scala sources (JVM or Scala.js)
```

Future extensions aim to integrate Cozy more deeply with SmartDox  
and the SimpleModeling knowledge ecosystem.
